# Prediction--using-H2O.ai

# Business Objective

When a customer applies for a loan at our company, we use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex, and extensive statistical analysis and modelling are required to predict the outcome for each individual case.

# Aim

implement a model that predicts if a loan should be granted to an individual based on the data provided
